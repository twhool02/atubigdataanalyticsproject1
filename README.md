Big Data Analytics Project 1 

This repository is used to store code for Big Data Analytics Project 1 as part of the Postgraduate Diploma in Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at Atlantic Technological University (ATU) 

This project analyses the Kaggle dataset  “StackSample: 10% of Stack Overflow Q&A” available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stacksample?select=Questions.csv)

There were two notebooks used for this analysis:

   This notebook contains the code used to test the hypothesis:
    a. The majority of questions will be related to the same 5 programming languages
    b. A user’s answer score will improve over time

2. Big_Data_Analytics_Project_1_Notebook_2
   This notebook contains the code used for Model Prediction
